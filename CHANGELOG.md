## Version History

### Unreleased - security hardening

A previewed Markdown document could run arbitrary JavaScript inside the preview
(scripts in the rendered HTML were deliberately re-executed), read any file on the
machine through the `local.example` virtual host, rewrite the editor buffer, and
launch programs through `file:`/custom-scheme links. Only open files from sources
you trust with older builds.

* Rendered HTML is sanitized with [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)
  before it is inserted into the preview: no `<script>`, event handlers,
  `javascript:` URLs, `<iframe>`/`<object>`/`<embed>`, `<form>`, `<meta>`, `<base>`.
  Inline HTML, `<style>`, `<details>`, task-list checkboxes, KaTeX, Mermaid, SVG
  icons and all `@mdit` plugin output keep working.
* Script tags found in a document are no longer executed. Trusted runtimes
  (Mermaid, Pannellum, highlight.js) are still loaded by the plugins themselves
  from the `assets` folder.
* Links are handed to the shell only for `http:`, `https:` and `mailto:`. Anything
  else is ignored. `target="_blank"` / `window.open` links go the same way instead
  of opening a popup WebView2 window.
* Every request that changes state (`PUT` document from the task-list/pano editors,
  `POST /webevent`, `POST /paste-image`, directory listings) requires a random
  per-session token that only the plugin's own page knows; requests without it get
  `403`.
* Pasted/dropped images can only be written below the document's folder.
* Build: `yarn build:app` no longer fails on a fresh clone because `dist/js` did
  not exist yet.

See `AnotherMarkdown/Resources/nppMdP.tests/Test-Security.md` for a manual
regression checklist.

Markup `![](image path)` inserted into current cursor position. 
Image naming is starts from 010.ext and incrementing with step 5, ie 010.jpg 015.jpg, 020.jpg, and each image stored in folder "./img" where markdown document located.  
Location can be changed by edit [assets/markdown/markdown.js]().
